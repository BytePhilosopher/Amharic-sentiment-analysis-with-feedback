# 🇪🇹 QalAnalyzer (ቃል Analyzer)

**QalAnalyzer** is a machine learning-based sentiment analysis tool for the Amharic language. It classifies Amharic text into three categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. Built with a focus on low-resource language NLP, this project uses classical ML methods and a simple web app interface for practical use in Ethiopia and beyond.
